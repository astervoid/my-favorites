    <p>
      Music is a fun and expressive form of art that anyone can participate in.
      I spend a lot of my time listening to music and building my own playlists.
      It's one of my favorite pastimes!

    <hr />
    <p>
      Five Nights at Freddy's is a popular mascot horror franchise created by
      indie game developer Scott Cawthon. It's a series that has lasted a very
      long time and continues to stay interesting and relevant, even inspiring
